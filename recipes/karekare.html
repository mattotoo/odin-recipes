        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kare-Kare is a delectable and iconic Filipino dish renowned for its rich and savory flavors. At its core, it's a sumptuous stew featuring tender oxtail, tripe, and a medley of vegetables like eggplant, string beans, and banana blossoms, all bathed in a luxuriously thick, peanut-based sauce. This creamy and nutty sauce is the star of the show, providing a delightful contrast to the natural sweetness of the vegetables. Kare-Kare is traditionally served with a side of shrimp paste (bagoong) and often enjoyed with fragrant rice, making it a beloved and indulgent feast that beautifully captures the essence of Filipino culinary diversity.</p>
